Dotfiles might be the most important files on any Unix, Linux or Mac system. They **backup**, **restore**, and **sync** the prefs and settings for your system and apps.

It is convenient that adding dotfiles to GitHub, and I do encourage you to do the same. Thanks to the community, I learned from some previous works and made my own version within two days.

Well, let's get started and see how to use my dotfiles.

## First things first

* Install **[Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)**.
* Install **Command Line Tools** for **[Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)** in Terminal: `xcode-select --install`.
